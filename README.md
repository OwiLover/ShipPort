# ShipPort
Random project for my University

This Project have 3 main goals

1-Create a Ship class which can be used for a Schedule (Ship has it's own name, !type! of something he is carring, weight etc.)

2-Create an auto-generating Schedule for ships which contains ships information and can be converted into JSON format (user must input number of generated ships) and feature to add ship manually (unlimited number of ships)

3-Create Cranes for Ships (when ship arrive, Crane must start disassembling what ship contains, but it must take some time for it (by using threads I guess))

2/3 already done, now learning how to actually code cranes

Code contains a LOT of trash right now, will polish it when it's done.
